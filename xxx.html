		<p id="intro">XXXTentacion, the burgeoning SoundCloud rapper whose criminal history is closely intertwined with his musical legacy, was catapulted into the public stratosphere nearly two years after his “Look at Me!” track was released online. The two-minute-thirty-second clip went live December 31, 2015. By April 22, 2017, it had peaked at No. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100. </p>
		<p id="p5">But the rapper, born Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, has prompted fans to “stop believing the rumors” of the heinous abuse charges filed against him by his ex-girlfriend. In an interview with the Miami New Times published Tuesday (June 5), Onfroy speaks to his tenuous yet tight-knit relationship with his mother, being against feminism but all here for astral projection, and other factors from his earlier life that have shaped who he is today.
		<p id="p6"> “Women may see or feel that they’re belittled, but you’re only belittled if you want to be belittled,” he argues about feminism. But the #MeToo movement has climactically revolutionized how much power women are allotted once they publicize allegations, according to the rapper. Geneva Ayala, Onfroy’s ex, whom he titled the outro from his No. 2 debut album 17 after, is one of those women he talks about with the New Times. Ayala, who was also interviewed for the piece, filed numerous charges against him, on accounts of domestic battery by strangulation, aggravated battery of a pregnant woman, armed home invasion and robbery -- not to mention false imprisonment and witness tampering -- but that “almost more powerful than men” chip Onfroy has on his shoulder kicked in when his family and friends called her to drop the charges.</p>
