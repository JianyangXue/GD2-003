		<p id="intro">During a time when we are all increasingly questioning our surroundings, from our entire social
			system to the four walls we live between, Travis Scott has been busy building his very own dream world. In
			just over a decade, the 28-year-old Houston native — born Jacques Bermon Webster II — has gone from
			university dropout to his generation’s undisputed leader, consistently meeting the constant demand for
			something instant, defiant, boundary-pushing and above all, authentic. His extraordinary ability to identify
			some prescient root in music and art and fashion, paired with a burning desire to create and collaborate,
			has put Travis at the forefront of hip-hop, pushing it forward into new places, new sounds. </p>
		<p id="p5"> He’s part rockstar, part hip-hop mogul – following in the footsteps of Pharrell Williams and Kanye
			West before him, but equally breaking out from those old templates into something newer, more modern, more
			flexible. Early on, he forgoed the tropes of traditional, lyrical rap with his own brand of
			atmospheric-yet-brash, lo-fi-yet-highly-autotuned soundscapes — blending the psychedelic with punk energy to
			win the hard-earned approval of today’s hip-hop fans. His seemingly single-minded approach to such vital
			decisions in his career often appear clairvoyant years later. A once eyebrow-raising, grungy approach to
			streetwear is today imitated by the masses, desperate to get their hands on whatever he co-signs in
			paparazzi shots, from the specific colour of a Supreme hoodie he threw on, to his own Air Jordan collab. His
			risks always come with a reward.
		<p id="p6"> While attending Belmont University studying music, Bren started dissecting the sound of gospel and
			R&B, the
			intricacies of which inspired him to begin creating his songs. "I'm big on musicality," he says. "I love
			crazy piano parts and unique chord structures and progressions." These have all made their way into his
			sound. Not only influenced by artists like Freddie Jackson, John Legend, and Kirk Franklin, who he listened
			to growing up, Bren also developed a love for alternative music while in college.</p>
		<p id="p7"> It was working with Kanye, both on the GOOD Music Cruel Summer compilation album and his own mixtape
			Owl Pharaoh around 2012, that a then freshly-signed Travis grabbed the attention of hip-hop fans. This began
			Travis’s rapid ascent to the top. He released his first studio album, Rodeo, in 2015 to acclaim, but it was
			its follow up, 2016’s Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight, where he began to lay out his blueprint;
			collaborating with hip-hop heavyweights like Kendrick Lamar and Young Thug, working with Nick Knight to
			shoot its iconic cover art, and taking to the skies on an animatronic bird during his now legendary and
			sweat-soaked live shows – where his loyal legion of teen fans obediently open up moshpits on command, as
			Travis demands they rage alongside him.
		<p id="p8"> feverishly spent the past two years seeking out any details they can find of his next album, set to
			release this year, and all they know so far is its title: Utopia.</p>
